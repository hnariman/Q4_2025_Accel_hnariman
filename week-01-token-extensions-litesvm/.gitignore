# These files/folders are required for Zero-Installs to function:

# Un-ignore essential sub-directories
!.yarn/cache
!.yarn/patches
!.yarn/plugins
!.yarn/releases
!.yarn/sdks
!.yarn/versions

# Ignore the state file which is regenerated
.yarn/install-state.gz

# Unplugged (generated by postinstall scripts, typically ignored)
.yarn/unplugged

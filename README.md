# Turbin3 Accelerated Builders Program: A Deep Dive into Solana's Frontier

![Turbin3 Banner](https://www.turbin3.org/images/turbin3.svg) ## üìú About this Repository

This repository documents my journey through the **Turbin3 2025 Accelerated Builders Program**, an intensive, multi-week course focused on the most advanced and cutting-edge technologies on the Solana blockchain.

The goal of this repository is not only to complete the coursework but to serve as a public testament to my skills, dedication, and expertise in the Solana ecosystem. It is my **proof-of-work** and **proof-of-skill**.

## üöÄ Course Overview & My Vision

The Turbin3 program is designed to move builders "from the known to the unknown," pushing the boundaries of what's possible on-chain. My participation reflects a commitment to staying at the forefront of blockchain innovation.

As an experienced SWE, my objective extends beyond simply learning these new technologies. My ambition is to **master** them, internalize their potential, and leverage this deep expertise to help **extend and grow the Solana ecosystem**. This repository is a public record of that process, demonstrating my ability to build with the next generation of on-chain primitives and contribute to the next wave of innovation.

## üìö Course Curriculum & Weekly Breakdown

This repository is structured to follow the official course timeline. Each folder will contain the code, notes, and projects from that week's module.

- **Week 0: Preparation Material**
  - _Objective:_ Establishing a solid foundation and environment setup for the advanced topics ahead.

- **Week 1: Token Extensions + LiteSVM**
  - _Focus:_ Deep dive into the new Token-2022 standard and its powerful extensions. Exploring the capabilities of running the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) in off-chain and cross-chain environments with LiteSVM.

- **Week 2: Ephemeral Rollups + RPCs and Indexing**
  - _Focus:_ Understanding and implementing state-of-the-art scaling solutions with ephemeral rollups. Mastering high-performance data retrieval and management through custom RPCs and advanced indexing strategies.

- **Week 3: All about Pinocchio**
  - _Focus:_ A comprehensive exploration of the Pinocchio ZK-SNARK protocol on Solana. Building applications that leverage zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy and computational integrity.

- **Week 4: MPL + Codama + Group Project**
  - _Focus:_ Working with the Metaplex Program Library (MPL) for next-generation NFTs and digital assets. Utilizing tools like Codama for streamlined program management. Collaborating on a significant group project to apply learned concepts.

- **Weeks 5-7: Shipping Window and Demo Day**
  - _Focus:_ Finalizing, polishing, and deploying a capstone project. Preparing and presenting a live demonstration of the project's functionality and technical innovation.
